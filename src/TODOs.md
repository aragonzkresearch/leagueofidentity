# TODOs
* BUG in web/Nintendo.sj: we cannot generate `codeVerifier` correctly. Currently it is manually fixed to given base64 strings.
* Better error handling, parsing of emails, phone numbers, compatibility of options
* Ethereum mode to enable signature verification onchain
* revocation via OCSP for DIC
* Example of token with social features? (e.g., token for Instagram users with a certain number of followers, or FB token for friends of a given user...)
